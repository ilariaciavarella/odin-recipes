        <h2>Your kitchen is going to smell amazing</h2>
        <p>You don't have to run to the mall to satisfy your craving for cinnamon rolls — soft and warm from the oven and drizzled
        with icing. We'll show you step by step how to make cinnamon rolls from scratch — from making the dough to filling,
        forming, baking, and icing — with loads of helpful tips along the way.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 packages active dry yeast</li>
            <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups warm water (45°C)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>6 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast and 1/3 cup sugar in warm water. Stir in salt and 2 cups flour. Beat mixture for
            2 minutes. Beat in eggs and oil. Stir in the remaining flour, ½ cup at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
            
            <li>When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about
            5 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and
            let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. In a small bowl, stir together ½ cup sugar and 2
            teaspoons cinnamon; set aside.</li>
            
            <li>Divide the dough into twelve equal pieces. Take each piece of dough, roll into a log and roll in cinnamon sugar mixture.
            Place the knots in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking pan. Cover the rolls with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled
            in volume, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 175°C.</li>
            
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, until golden.</li>
        </ol>
