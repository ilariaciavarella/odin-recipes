        <h2>The perfect combo featuring the best of each classic dessert</h2>
        <p>I made this for Thanksgiving and am making it again for Christmas. A huge hit. But the silky texture was what sold all
        of us. The crust was amazing. There were no leftovers after eating a huge dinner. People who refused dessert saw other's
        reaction to this and then asked for a small slice. Incredible.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Crust</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups crushed graham crackers</li>
            <li>¼ cup finely chopped toasted pecans</li>
            <li>¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>2 cups packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sour cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Topping</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dark rum</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups coarsely chopped toasted pecans</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast and 1/3 cup sugar in warm water. Stir in salt and 2 cups flour. Beat mixture for
            2 minutes. Beat in eggs and oil. Stir in the remaining flour, ½ cup at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
            
            <li>When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about
            5 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and
            let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. In a small bowl, stir together ½ cup sugar and 2
            teaspoons cinnamon; set aside.</li>
            
            <li>Divide the dough into twelve equal pieces. Take each piece of dough, roll into a log and roll in cinnamon sugar mixture.
            Place the knots in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking pan. Cover the rolls with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled
            in volume, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 175°C.</li>
            
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, until golden.</li>
        </ol>
