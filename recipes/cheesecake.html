        <h2>The perfect combo featuring the best of each classic dessert</h2>
        <p>I made this for Thanksgiving and am making it again for Christmas. A huge hit. But the silky texture was what sold all
        of us. The crust was amazing. There were no leftovers after eating a huge dinner. People who refused dessert saw other's
        reaction to this and then asked for a small slice. Incredible.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Crust</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups crushed graham crackers</li>
            <li>¼ cup finely chopped toasted pecans</li>
            <li>¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>2 cups packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sour cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Topping</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dark rum</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups coarsely chopped toasted pecans</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 175°C. Spray a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray; line bottom with a
            round of parchment paper, and wrap outside of pan with heavy duty aluminum foil. Combine graham cracker crumbs, pecans,
            sugar, cinnamon, and salt for the crust in a bowl. Stir in melted butter until mixture has a sand-like consistency.</li>
            
            <li>Press crumb mixture evenly into the bottom and up the sides of the prepared pan using a flat-bottomed measuring cup or
            your fingers.</li>
            
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven on the center oven rack until lightly browned and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Remove from
            oven and cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 165°C, and place oven
            rack in lower third position.</li>
            
            <li>Meanwhile, combine cream cheese and brown sugar in a food processor and process until smooth and no lumps remain, about
            45 seconds, scraping down sides as needed. Add eggs, 1 at a time, pulsing once after each addition. Add sour cream,
            flour, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt; pulse 2 to 3 times or until combined. Pour batter into cooled crust.</li>

            <li>Bake in the hot oven at 165°C on rack in lower third position until center jiggles slightly, 45
            to 50 minutes. Turn oven off, prop oven door open slightly, and let cheesecake stand in oven 1 hour. Remove from oven,
            discard foil, and run a knife around around edge of crust to release from pan (to avoid cracks while cooling). Cover
            with plastic wrap, and chill at least 6 hours or overnight.</li>

            <li>For the topping set a a medium nonstick saucepan over low heat. Add sugar in an even layer and cook over low,
            undisturbed, until warm, about 2 minutes. Add water, and stir constantly until all the sugar is melted, about 45
            seconds. Add butter, stirring constantly until butter is melted and incorporated, about 30 seconds.</li>

            <li>Increase heat to medium; add heavy cream, rum, cinnamon, and vanilla, and cook, stirring constantly, until well combined
            and slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Add pecans, stirring until well coated, and remove from heat. Cool until room
            temperature and thickened, about 30 minutes.</li>

            <li>Remove cheesecake from refrigerator, and carefully remove from springform pan. Place on a serving platter, and top with
            cooled pecan pie topping. Serve immediately, or allow cheesecake to soften for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
